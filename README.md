# Arduino-musical-lightshow

This is project I worked on a few years ago, It was inspired by this project I found online:
https://maker.pro/arduino/projects/christmas-light-show-with-arduino

It's a chritmass light show with arduino. The system works with a MIDI file stored in a SD card. The data on the SD card gets read by the arduino program, which converts each note to a corresponding integer 0-23, which then maps to an output of one of the shift registers.
